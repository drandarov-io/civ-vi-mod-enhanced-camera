[*] Significantly increases zoom ranges at min and max
[*] Adjusts tilt curves to have a more perpendicular camera angle in the middle and flatter at the most zoomed in for screenshots
[*] Adjusts fog density curves to fit the new zoom curve and start slightly later

Basic idea originates from Tactical Camera by Tom Illar.
